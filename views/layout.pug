              | Bridging the gap between design and implementation, I believe
              | performant and secure applications can still look and feel great
              | to the user. In my spare time, I love to draw, paint and build
              | games. Ready for opportunities to create. At the moment I am looking
              | for fulltime work as a frontend or fullstack developer. I also have contractual
              | experience assisting startups and non-profits through the creation of prototypes, mockups, wireframes, designs, pitches and project planning.
              | If you have an app idea and need assistance conceptualizing it and preparing it for the pitch stage I can help.
